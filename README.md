## Getting Started:

### View the deployed page here:
LINK

<table>
<tr>
<td>
  Upon loading the page, you are prompted to sign in or sign up for the service.  Once registered and signed in, you will view the details for the event.  This includes a description as well as a list of all participants registered.  You can register as many participants as you'd like using the register button.  Once registered, you can manage your registrations by either updating or deleting them entirely.  Once finished, you can log out to exit the app.
